## About Me

Computer and Network Engineering student at SMK Negeri 1 Surabaya.  
Currently focusing on <b>programming, cybersecurity (mostly attack side), and system administration.</b>  
I like figuring out how things work — sometimes by breaking them first.  
Still learning how to build more reliable systems and write cleaner code.  
I’m open to new challenges, projects, and opportunities that can help me grow as a developer and problem-solver.

## Technical Focus Areas

- **Cybersecurity (mostly offensive, learning defense)**  
  I spend most of my time on CTFs, exploit development, and reversing.  
  I focus on offense because I enjoy breaking things, but I’m also learning defensive practices to understand how systems are protected.

- **Backend & APIs (work in progress)**  
  I prefer backend work — APIs, databases, and server logic.

- **Personal Server & Linux basics**  
  I run and test things on my own Linux machines — nothing fancy yet, mostly self-hosting and basic deployment experiments.
